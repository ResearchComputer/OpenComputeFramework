# OCF Protocol

Open Compute Protocol is a layered protocol that provides a common interface for "providing services", "requesting services", across a decentralized peer-to-peer network. The protocol is *conflict-free*, meaning that all nodes in the network will eventually agree on the same state of the network.

There are several layers to the protocol:

- Peer-to-peer Communication: each node in the network is a peer, and can communicate with any other peer in the network as long as the peer-id is known.
