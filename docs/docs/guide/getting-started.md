# Quick Start

## Inspect Network Status

We provide a simple command line tool to inspect the status of the network. You can use it to check the status of the network, or to check the status of your own node.

```bash
$ pip install -U ocf-cli
```

To check the service provided by the network, run:

```bash
ocf list service
```

To check the nodes in the network, run:

```bash
ocf list node
```
